# Complement virus

** NOT A REAL VIRUS **

The purpose of this program is to be a background process that displays random messages of encouragement throughout the day.

A config file should be provided so that the user has the ability to decide the frequency of messages

config.js have params lowerBound and upperBound. Complements will appear in this time span 

** If the options are lowerBound = 10 and upperBound = 30, then the message will appear sometime in a 10 to 30 minute range

Create a shortcut to the `startup.bat` file and move that to your startup folder

** MAKE SURE YOU DO `yarn` OR `npm i` TO GET ALL THE PACKAGES
